This is an experimental plugin, the ultimate goal is to achieve tiddlywiki theme switching;
Since tiddlywiki uses palette to switch color themes (for me personally, modifying the palette is very cumbersome, and the existing palette style does not satisfy me, I just want to switch between dark and light themes), if you want With the help of tailwindcss, a set of code supports switching between dark and light themes, which may require a large number of templates to be modified, which is currently unrealistic and may even affect additional side effects (not yet thought of), if you have any ideas, Comments welcome
